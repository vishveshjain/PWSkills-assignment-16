    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database management systems that do not use the traditional relational database model that SQL databases use. Instead, NoSQL databases use different data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, or graph.\n",

    "NoSQL databases are preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, agility, and flexibility in handling large, unstructured or semi-structured data.
